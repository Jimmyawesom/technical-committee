## Health metrics

*How to assess project health depends on the context of the concrete project. Please answer the questions below and add any additional explanations or data you see as useful to show that the project has a healthy community and development activity.*

### How many active contributors does the project have?

*An active contributor is a person who has repeatedly contributed over the last twelve months. Please provide the links to the GitHub contributors statistics (e.g., https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/osrd/graphs/contributors) or any equivalent references.*

### How many different organizations are contributing to the project?

*This can be reported by looking at the email addresses of contributors in the commit log.*

### How much is the project dependent on individual contributors?

*How high is the risk to a project should the most active people leave? This is called the [Contributor Absence Factor](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-contributor-absence-factor/), sometimes also referred to as bus factor.*


## Open governance

### What is the release process of the project?

*Please provide a link to a document which describes the release process. This should explain how changes are communicated, versioning schemes, signing of release artifacts, etc.*

### How are decisions made in the project?

This should explain the decision making process, including how technical decision are made such as accepting pull requests or deciding about technical architecture. The GOVERNANCE.md file should document the decision making process, which won't change very often.
