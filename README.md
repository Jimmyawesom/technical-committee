This repository is the entry point for the work of the technical committee (TC) of the [OpenRail Association](https://openrailassociation.org/). It contains the charter of the TC and is meant as a working area to facilitate the work of the TC.

_Note that the OpenRail Association still is in its formal formation process. So the work here is the result of the community of founding partners and will be formally validated once the formation process has concluded._
