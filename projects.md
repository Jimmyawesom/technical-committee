## Administrative Projects

There are some projects within OpenRail Association outside of the railway and transportation domain. They are used for managing the technical infrastructure of the OpenRail Association or for general purposes of the organization. They do not follow the incubation process but follow best practices depending on their criticality.

* [compliance-assistant](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/compliance-assistant), helping with tasks for license reviews, e.g. creating and enriching SBOMs
* [FOSDEM](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/FOSDEM) for organizing the "Railways and Open Transportation" devroom at the FOSDEM conference
* [github-org-manager](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/github-org-manager) to manage permissions and settings in a GitHub organization
* [landscape](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/landscape), and experimental overview of Open Source projects in railways and transportation
* [openrail-dns](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/openrail-dns), domain records configuration for some of OpenRail's domains
