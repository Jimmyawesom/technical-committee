# Checklist for onboarding new projects

This checklist serves as a guide for the steps being taken when onboarding new projects as official OpenRail Association projects after they have been accepted by the vote of the board in stage 1 of the incubation process.

* Document project status on [project list](projects.md)
* Plan meeting with maintainers to discuss onboarding and clear expectations, and plan next steps
* Add project representative to Technical Committee
* Move repositories to OpenRail Association organization on GitHub
* Move web site to GitHub Pages within the OpenRail Association organization (if separate web page exists)
* Review repos and make sure that they have necessary files (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, MAINTAINERS.md, etc.) (TODO: document what the necessary files are and what should be in them)
* Add project to web site
