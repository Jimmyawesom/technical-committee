# TC Meeting 2024-03-14

Present: Cornelius, Loic, Peter

## Agenda

* RCM OSS proposal (https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/pull/39)
* Badges (https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/42)

## Protocol

* RCM OSS proposal
  * We agree on the move of the code of the rcm-dx repository with the specification to the OpenRail Association.
  * The binary of the viewer will still be hosted by SBB at a place external to OpenRail, because we want to stick to only open source code on the OpenRail side and we have no way of recreating or releasing the binary without access to the private repositories where it's built
  * The example data will also still be hosted by SBB
  * Plan for 2024 and 2025 is to develop a library for reading and writing the RCM-DX format. This will be hosted in the rcm-dx repository
  * Publishing the viewer as open source is currently not realistically doable. Distribution of the binary by a 3rd party is fine.
  * The TC decides to accept the proposal
  * We will propose to put the decision by the board to validate the decision on the agenda at the beginning of todays board meeting
  * For the decision Peter will do a very brief presentation of RCM OSS based on the questionnaire
* Badges
  * We have the proposals in the GitHub issue and some discussion
  * We will use the simple generated badges for GitHub READMEs etc. and the graphical versions for material where there is more space
  * Suggestion: Do another iteration of the first and last line with the text OpenRail added and using colors to disinguish the stages. The colors and text should be similar in in the two variants fo the badges (the generated text ones and the graphical ones)
