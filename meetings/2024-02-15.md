## Protocol

Present: Cornelius, Peter, Loic

* Organize onboarding of OSRD (see checklist at https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/pull/28)
  * Start with meeting next Thursday (2024-02-22, 14:00) with all maintainers to get to know them and decide next steps
  * Use meeting to plan follow-up meetings to do the technical work of moving the repositories
  * Discuss separation of repositories (upstream, downstream, downstream depends on upstream, but not the other way around)
* Discuss what is needed to define requirements for project governance (https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/8)
  * MVG is too explicit on decision making. Let that be decided by the project.
  * Two levels of governance:
    * Upstream governance for technical decisions, such as merging pull request
    * Downstream governance for business decisions such as roadmap, where to allocate resources etc.
    * We need to find the right balance, so that the business stays in charge of the business decisions
  * MVG section about trademarks is not needed
  * The MVG steering committee is our Technical Committee
  * Next step is to create a concrete governance document proposal for OpenRail Association (cornelius)
* Questions from prospective member
  * Peter has drafted an answer, we will make another round of review and edits and then send it to the people who asked the question
* Project badges
  * Loic will ask a designer to create a draft for the badges. We can start with a generic badge, maybe with different colors for the stages and later refine it, when we have finally decided on the stages and their names.
