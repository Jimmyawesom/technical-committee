## Protocol

* REUSE (see also https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/pull/80#issuecomment-2178500733)
  * New version of REUSE was published which comes with a new way of defining licenses for multiple file using a toml file
  * Criteria for stage 2:
    * Be REUSE compliant, the declaration with the toml file is a valid option
    * Check REUSE compliance automatically (use standard GitHub action)
    * Recommendation to add license headers to all files where technically possible
* Switch on DCO bot for TC repo
  * We add the GitHub action on the technical-committee repo so we meet our own standards and learn how it works in practice
  * Add documentation how to set it up with git for contributors (in the project-handbook in the TC repo)
* Onboarding of liblrs
  * Next step: Florian invites maintainers to next meeting 
* Apply for github teams plan for nonprofit organization: https://support.github.com/contact/nonprofit
  * Cornelius will apply for the plan
