ensure their success.

The Chair of the TC is elected once a year from among the TC members. The Chair is responsible for ensuring that meetings are conducted according to the rules described below, and for communicating the decisions made at these meetings to the Board and the wider Openrail Foundation community.

The current TC Chair is responsible for electing the next TC Chair and remains responsible for the TC Chair duties until the next TC Chair is elected.

## Meetings
