## Open questions

* Should the TC suggest projects? (https://github.com/OpenRailFoundation/technical-committee/pull/1)

## Decided questions

* Should there be a sunset period after which the TC is only formed by the projects, not by appointees of the Platinum members? (https://github.com/OpenRailFoundation/technical-committee/pull/3) (Closed)
* What happens when the chair leaves a project and is not eligible anymore? (https://github.com/OpenRailFoundation/technical-committee/pull/4) (Applied)
* Are there specific requirements for the members of the TC, i.e. being software engineers, being actively working on projects (https://github.com/OpenRailFoundation/technical-committee/pull/2) (Closed)
* Maintainers are busy people. Should they be members of the TC or should projects be able to send another person to the TC instead? (https://github.com/OpenRailFoundation/technical-committee/pull/5) (Applied)
