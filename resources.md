# Resources

This is a collection of useful resources regarding the structure, organization, and work of a technical committee or comparable organizational bodies in open source organizations and projects. A project refers to a concrete software and community, while the organization refers to a higher level structure providing a home for multiple projects.

## General

* [Open Governance](https://github.com/opengovernance/opengovernance.dev) - Information about open governance models for open source projects and organizations
* [Minimum Vialble Governance](https://github.com/github/MVG) - Framework for minimal governance for open source projects

## Examples

### Overall technical governance and project coordination

* [Eclipse Foundation Development Process](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/)
* [Apache Corporate Governance](https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/) - Definition of how the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/) operates. Projects are managed through [Project Management Committees (PMCs)](https://www.apache.org/foundation/governance/pmcs.html)
* [CNCF Technical Oversight Committee](https://www.cncf.io/people/technical-oversight-committee/) ([Principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/PRINCIPLES.md), [Graduation Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.md))
* [CNCF Lifecycle Process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/README.md) - Process how the CNCF manages the lifecycle of its projects, from acceptance over gradutation to retirement
* Cloud Foundry has a [Technical Oversight Committee](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/TOC.md) for cross-cutting product and design decisions

### Project governance

* [Project charter template](https://github.com/lf-energy/tsc-template/blob/main/tsc/CHARTER.md) of [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/), which is part of a general [project template](https://github.com/lf-energy/tsc-template) (also see LF Energy's overall [governance](https://www.lfenergy.org/governance/))
* [Istio](https://github.com/istio) has a combination of a [steering committee](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/steering/README.md) and a [technical oversight committee](https://github.com/istio/community/blob/master/TECH-OVERSIGHT-COMMITTEE.md)
