# Incubation process
*This is a draft*

## Funnel: 
The project is candidate. The foundation proceeds to compliance, business and technical evaluation.

### Compliance evaluation: 
-	The project provides all the documents (IP, CoC, License, …)
-	The TC check that the project is compliant with the ORF rules.

### Business evaluation
-	The project describes the need it fulfils, and which strategic themes are concerned by the project.
-	The project explains the business roadmap.

### Technical evaluation
-	The project describes the release plan.
-	The project describes the version(s):
  - Is there a community version working on open data?
  - Is there an enterprise version?
  - …
-	The project describes all the stack.
-	The project describes the architecture of the software.
-	The project describes its governance

## TC evaluation and advice to the Board of Directors
The evaluation has to be done for each version of the project.
A comuunity version could be accepted and not the enterprise version.

## The Board of Director validates the candidate as a project hosted by the OpenRail Foundation
